API Documentation
=================

The AssetHost API is a fairly straight-forward REST-like API.

## API Users

Users for the API are created in the admin panel at `/api_users`.  Each user is assigned permissions on if they can read/write certain resources.  At the moment, the only resources are **Asset** and **Output**.

When a user is created, they are automatically assigned an auth token.  This token should be sent through the `auth_token` parameter in each request.  In production, HTTPS should be used since this token has no inherent security features â€“ it's merely an identifier for a user.

## Endpoints

**Get:** `/api/assets/{id}`

**Post:** `/api/assets/`

A POST request can take the following parameters:

- **X_FILE_NAME:** The file name of the asset being uploaded.
- **CONTENT_TYPE:** The MIME type of the asset file.
