AssetHost
=========

📸 AssetHost is a one-stop-shop for hosting and linking to media assets that are intended for inclusion in news stories.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SCPR/AssetHost.png)](https://travis-ci.org/SCPR/AssetHost)

The goal is to create a hub that multiple frontend CMS systems can hook into, querying images, videos and documents from one source and enabling the easier interchange of data.

AssetHost includes:

- 💽 A server application provides the primary UI for uploading, managing, and  
serving assets.
- 🔌 An API endpoint that can be accessed by other applications or plugins.
- 🖥️ A Chooser UI that can be integrated into your application with a minimal amount of code.

Plus:

- A powerful search function built on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) & [Searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick).
- Automatic tagging of image features using deep-learning through [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), allowing for images to become searchable upon upload with no user intervention.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Minimum Requirements:

- Docker
- MySQL

*The minimum requirements will get the application up and running, but many features will not work.  For production functionality, you will need the following:*

- Redis
- Elasticsearch
- Memcached

### Setup

AssetHost can be run from a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image.  Once you have Docker set up on a machine, pull the AssetHost image from Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull ravenstine/assethost
```

Alternatively, you can build the image from the provided [Dockerfile](https://github.com/SCPR/AssetHost/blob/v3.0.0/Dockerfile), although it will take a while to finish:

```sh
docker build -t ravenstine/assethost .
```

AssetHost expects MySQL and various other storage engines such as Redis & Elasticsearch to be available.  The connection settings and credentials should be provided through environment variables.  It is best to store these variables in a **.env** file.  A sample .env file is provided in `config/templates/.env.template`; the variables that are uncommented are required, and the ones commented out are optional for minimal operation.  It is suggested you use a **.env** file because it is already excluded from version tracking and it automatically gets loaded by the application if you need to run it outside of a Docker environment during development.

Once you have obtained an image and filled out your **.env** file, you can then run the image in a new Docker container.

```sh
docker run -i -d -p 80:80 --name assethost --env-file .env ravenstine/assethost
```

Note that the `--name` parameter specifies the name of the new container, and the last parameter is the name of the image.  `--name` can be left blank and Docker will assign a random name to it.  It's recommended that you pick a name and stick with it.

Now that the container is running, you will need to initialize your database.  To do this, run:

```sh
docker exec assethost setup
```

This will double-check if all Ruby dependencies are met and will then create a MySQL database with the required tables.  If you already have a database created for AssetHost, you will not need to perform this step again when creating a new container.

Finally, you can run the application like this:

```sh
docker exec assethost server
```

Essentially, you are telling it to run the `server` script located inside the assethost container.

On first use, you will be required to log in.  An initial user called **admin** already exists with the password **password**.  Use those credentials to log in, and then promptly change the password to a more suitable one.

To run a worker for asynchronous image encoding:

```sh
docker exec assethost worker
```

The worker is responsible for resizing & saving assets in the background.  This saves on storage space as we are only creating different thumbnail sizes as needed.  An asset might only ever be needed in one size, so it doesn't make sense to render it in every output size.


## Workflow

1. Photographer / Author / Editor goes to AssetHost and uploads or imports 
a media asset.

2. Author / Editor goes to their frontend CMS and uses the plugin UI to 
select the asset they want to attach to their content (which might be a 
story, a blog post, etc).

3. CMS plugin uses API to query AssetHost and retrieve presentation code 
for the asset.  

4. The CMS should call new AssetHost.Client() to put in place the handler 
for rich assets.

4. The CMS should display the image asset.  If it contains tags for a 
rich asset, the Client library will catch it and put in place the 
appropriate handling.

5. AssetHost will return a 302 Found to the rendered image asset if it 
exists, or render it on-the-fly if it does not yet exist.


## Image Storage

AssetHost supports Amazon S3 as a storage backend.  For in-house storage,
you can use [Riak CS](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs), which implements
the S3 API and can be used in the same way.  For AssetHost to work properly, AWS credentials for S3 need to be set as these environment variables:

- ASSETHOST_S3_BUCKET
- ASSETHOST_S3_REGION
- ASSETHOST_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- ASSETHOST_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

When using Riak, you can provide the host under the `ASSETHOST_S3_ENDPOINT` and comment out the `ASSETHOST_S3_REGION` variable.

Local filesystem storage may be implemented in the future.


## Rich Media Support

Rich media assets are delivered as specially-tagged img tags, and are 
replaced on the client-side via an AssetHost.Client plugin.

### Brightcove Video

Brightcove videos can be imported as assets and used to place videos into image display contexts. The video is delivered as an img tag, and the AssetHost.Client library will see the tag and call the AssetHost.Client.Brightcove plugin. The plugin will replace the asset with the video.

Brightcove assets can be imported via a key in the URL Input field.

## Feature Recognition

For the purpose of improving ease of searchability, AssetHost can tie into Amazon's Rekognition service which uses computer-vision to classify features inside a given image.  When enabled, photos are automatically populated with
keywords without any user intervention.  For example, a photo of people mountain biking will be immediately searchable with queries like "bicycle" or "outdoors" upon upload even when no metadata is provided.  This optional feature can be enabled when AWS credentials are set in the following environment variables:

- ASSETHOST_REKOGNITION_REGION
- ASSETHOST_REKOGNITION_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- ASSETHOST_REKOGNITION_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


## Development

AssetHost is a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)-based application.  

### Prerequisites

The application requires the following prerequisites:

- Ruby >= 2.3
- Rails >= 5.0.0
- Imagemagick
- Exiftool
- MySQL
- Redis
- Elasticsearch >= 1.6.0
- Memcached

### Installation

Like when running the Docker container, you will be using a **.env** file for configuration.  Outside a Docker container, AssetHost will look for a **.env** in the project root directory and use those variables.  As mentioned above, there's a sample **.env** file in `config/templates/.env.template`.

Once the required variables have been populated, you can install dependencies by running the setup script:

```sh
bin/setup
```

To start the server:

```sh
rails s
```

*The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.*

To start a worker:

```sh
QUEUE=assets rake resque:work
```


## Credits

AssetHost is being developed to serve the media asset needs of [KPCC](https://scpr.org) 
and Southern California Public Radio, a member-supported public radio network that 
serves Los Angeles and Orange County on 89.3, the Inland Empire on 89.1, and the 
Coachella Valley on 90.3.

AssetHost development is currently led by Ben Titcomb and was originally written by
Eric Richardson & Bryan Ricker.
