## These options determine the host, port, and protocol
## contained in the URLs returned by assets in the API
## and admin interface.  They *do not* determine the actual
## host name, port, or protocol that the server runs on.
## In the future, these options will become optional when
## they can be autodetected from the requests themselves.

## You will only ever need to set this if you don't
## want AssetHost to choose a database name for you.
# ASSETHOST_DATABASE_NAME=

## The following database variables are technically
## optional, especially if you have [skip-grant-tables]
## enabled for MySQL in development.  In production,
## you will almost certainly need to set these.

# ASSETHOST_DATABASE_PASSWORD=

## It's possible that you'll want the users table to
## be stored in a separate database that can be shared
## with other applications.  If so, you provide the
## credentials here.

## Otherwise, this variable is ignored.

## The value should be a comma-delimited list of
